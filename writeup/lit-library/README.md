#Literature Library
A crucial part of the UNBIASED Pscale project is to review the existing literature available on common pressure markers.
Due to unfortunate copyright constraints, we cannot post all of these papers here, however we do provide a number of useful tools, such as a comprehensive bibtex citation file, as well as summarizing notes on a subset of the publications used for this project.

##Note to collaborators
Collaborators should restrict themselves to using the citations (and corresponding citation keys) found within the bibtex files in this directory.
If additional citations are necessary, please feel free to add them to the appropriate .bib file, rather than linking to a personal bibtex file.
This enables a uniform approach to citations in collaborative documents.

###Convenient pdf access with jabRef
To enable jabRef (and other?) bibliographic utilities to find the pdf files corresponding to each citation, create a symlink (or alias) to your personal pdf directory.
Name the symlink 'pdfdif', and jabRef will automatically be able to open your pdfs, while git will conveniently ignore this personal file.
This is accomplished on Mac, Linux, or Unix machines with the following command inside the current directory:

```
ln -s path/to/pdf/dir pdfdir
```
