	the use of bcc-{B}i as a pressure marker is expected to give improved

The interionic potential is taken to be the sum of pairwise additive Coulomb, van der Waals attraction, and repulsive interactions. In addition, to account for the observed large Cauchy violation of the elastic constants of MgO, the breathing shell model (BSM) is introduced in MD simulation, in which the repulsive radii of O ions are allowed to deform isotropically under the effects of other ions in the crystal. Quantum correction to the MD pressure is made using the Wigner-Kirkwood expansion of the free energy. Required energy parameters, including oxygen breathing parameters, were derived empirically to reproduce the observed molar volume and elastic constants of MgO, and their measured temperature and pressure derivatives as accurately as possible. The MD simulation with BSM is found to be very successful in reproducing accurately the measured molar volumes and individual elastic constants of MgO over a wide temperature and pressure range. The errors in the simulated molar volumes are within 0.3% over the temperature range between 300 and 3000 K at 0 GPa, and within 0.1% over the pressure range from 0 up to 50 GPa at 300 K. The simulated bulk modulus is found to be correct to within 0.7% between 300 and 1800 K at 0 GPa. Here we present the MD simulated T-P-V equation of state of MgO as an accurate internal pressure calibration standard at high temperatures and high pressures.}

	pressure were observed by in situ {X}-ray diffraction and quench
	experiments at pressures near that of the 660 km seismic discontinuity
	and at a fixed temperature of 1600 °{C}. {A}ccording to results obtained
	by in situ {X}-ray diffraction experiments, ringwoodite ({R}w) was
	observed with majorite garnet and {C}a{S}i{O}3-rich perovskite at
	pressures of about 20-22 {GP}a. {D}issociation of ringwoodite to
	{M}g{S}i{O}3-rich perovskite and magnesiowüstite ({M}w) was completed
	at 22.0±0.2 {GP}a according to {M}atsui et al.’s periclase pressure
	scale, and at 21.7±0.1 {GP}a according to {S}him et al.’s gold pressure
	scale. {M}ajorite garnet persisted to about 24 {GP}a where pyrolite
	transformed to a lower mantle mineral assemblage, i.e. {M}g{S}i{O}3-perovskite,
	{C}a{S}i{O}3-rich perovskite, and magnesiowüstite. {T}hus, majorite
	garnet coexists with the lower mantle assemblage at pressures of
	about 22-24 {GP}a. {I}n the quench experiments, an assemblage of
	{M}g{S}i{O}3-perovskite, magnesiowüstite, {C}a{S}i{O}3-rich perovskite,
	and majorite garnet was synthesized at 22.5 {GP}a and 1600 °{C},
	in which {M}g-perovskite contained 2.8 wt.% {A}l2{O}3, and was significantly
	poorer in {F}e than coexisting magnesiowüstite. {T}he {F}e-{M}g partition
	coefficient between {M}g-perovskite and magnesiowüstite including
	ferric iron ({K}app=0.27±0.06) is very close to that in the {A}l-free
	system, which suggests that these {P}-{T} conditions are in the vicinity
	of those of ringwoodite decomposition. {B}oth the results of in situ
	{X}-ray diffraction and quench experiments in the present study yield
	a convergent result that ringwoodite decomposes into {M}g-perovskite
	and magnesiowüstite before the garnet-to-perovskite transition at
	1600 °{C} in pyrolite. {T}he relation between the {A}l content in
	{M}g-perovskite and {K}app in pyrolite is non-linear, which is consistent
	with the {F}e-{M}g partitioning between {M}g-perovskite and magnesiowüstite
	previously reported for a simpler {M}g{O}-{F}e{O}-{A}l2{O}3-{S}i{O}2
