UnBIASeD (Unified Bayesian Iterative And Systematically Determined) Pressure Scale Project

Welcome to the home of the UnBIASeD pressure scale project!
Our goal here is to continuously provide well calibrated pressure markers for high pressure and temperature experiments.
These experiments are crucial to our understanding of material properties at extreme conditions, with major applications in both materials science and Earth Science. 

We approach this goal using two major strategies: by providing an open database of past experiments as well as a Bayesian framework for interpreting those measurements.
